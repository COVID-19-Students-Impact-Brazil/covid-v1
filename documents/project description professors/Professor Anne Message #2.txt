Dear Professor Anne,

Thank you very much for your interest and quickly response!
As I wrote on the message before, our agency, FAPESP, in this fast-track call "aims bolster the formation of collaborative research networks (international, national and/or local)‚Äù to "accelerate the development of results and increase their reach".(https://fapesp.br/14879/covid-19un-research-roadmap-call-for-proposals). 
Thus, I believe your part in the project could be to collaborate in refining the focal objectives to be investigated, suggest procedures and help analyzing the findings. No time commitment is specified or required in the fast call to the research partner so, it's an open question that we can reach an agreement with.
I'm guessing that the findings in your recent COVID-19's impact study could help us in our project, because I believe both share similar objectives.
I'm finishing a draft proposal and I intend send you a preliminar version this week for your appraisal.
Once again, I thank you in advance for your interest and your help.
